- 👋 Hi, I’m @riosaltas
- 👀  I’m fascinated by cutting-edge technologies including computer science, machine learning, deep learning, brain-computer interfaces (BCI), advanced robotics and autonomous systems, and neural interfaces. Understanding and harnessing the power of these intricate systems fuels my curiosity and drives me to innovate.
- 🌱 Currently, I'm delving into the realm of BCIs and neural interfaces, uncovering their transformative potential across various industries such as healthcare, security, and entertainment. Furthermore, I'm broadening my comprehension of neuroinformatics, computational models of the brain, and massive-scale neural simulations. From a software standpoint, I'm honing my abilities in full-stack web development, cloud computing, and DevOps methodologies.
- 💞️ Collaboration sparks creativity, so I'm eager to team up with fellow thinkers sharing my excitement for progress and exploration. Be it crafting ingenious AI algorithms, designing next-gen BCI devices, or constructing robust cloud architecture, I'd relish joining your endeavor and contributing my competencies. Together, let's engineer brilliance!
